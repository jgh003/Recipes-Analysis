# Recipes Analysis: Healthy & Delicious

By: Joseph Hernandez

# Introduction

This data science project, conducted at UCSD, focuses on the question:
> "What is the relationship between rating and healthiness of foods?"

Researching this question is relevant because it provides insight on a problem point when it comes to eating healthier. From experience, I've noticed that some people prefer to eat unhealthy foods and I wonder if this is something that happns on a larger scale, or even contributes to obesity in the US. Essentially, I investigate the differences between how people rate healthy foods versus less healthy foods.

In addition, the American population highlights the need for research on topics such as this one, because when it comes to the obesity rates for American citizens, the numbers don't look good... "At least one in five adults (20%) in each U.S. state is living with obesity" ([cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0912-adult-obesity.html)). To give you some perspective. Take for example, Kansas. According to the CDC, it has one of the highest obesity rates in the country with a population size of roughly 2,937,880 people ([census.gov](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/KS/HSG010223)). Now imagine, if 20% of them were obese... That's 587,576 people (almost 600,000 in just one state)!
